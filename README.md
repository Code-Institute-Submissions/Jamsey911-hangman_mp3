# Hangman - Game

# Introduction
Project milestone 3 for Code Institute Full-stack development program: Python Terminal.<br><brZ>
This project was created by myself to show a simple game using python and ran through heroku. The main goal of the game is to guess letters in order to find the word that the computer randomly selects.

## User Experience - UX

### User Stories

* As a website creator, I want to:
  
1. Build an game to navigate.
2. Build a simple game to understand.
3. Build a game with images being visible which changes when the user progresses
   
* As a first time user, I want to:

1. As a First Time user, i want the program to be easy to navigate
2. As a First Time user, i want to be able to see the progress of the hangman image displayed at all stages.
3. As a First Time user, i want to be shown progress in letters i've selected.
4. As a First Time user, i want to advised if an incorrect input has been selected.
   
* As a returning visitor, I want to:

1. As a Returning user, be able to play the game again with a different word as chosen by the computer.
2. As a Returning user, I want to be able to navigate through the app consistently.
   
## Design

#### Colours
* A Sort red was chosen as a background to make the app stand out from the page and Python Colorama Model was installed in which some simple colours were chosen to make the app more visually appealing.
The colours in the game are supplied by the Python Colorama Model

### Flowcharts 
<!-- ![Flowcharts](./assets/images/readme/hangman-flowcharts.jpg)<br>
I spent time planning and thinking about the logic and flow behind the game to ensure I had a general idea of how it could be built. I created flowcharts to assist me with the logical flow throughout the application. The charts were generated using [Lucidchart](https://lucid.app/) Integration and are shown below.<br> -->

## Features

### Logo and Intro Message
